# Spring Boot

Spring boot enables robust creation of applications. It provides features like servers, metrics, health checks, etc. Spring Boot allows for integration with many different servers, but by itself, it is neither an application server nor a web server

Auto configuration is a great feature of Spring Boot whereby it provides all the required dependencies to start a particular project. For example, starter web automatically configures everything needed for a web application. Similarly, starter JPA automatically configures basic JPA along with Hibernate

Spring Boot Features

# SB Autoconfiguration

Without Spring Boot, creating a simple web application can be a daunting and time-consuming task. When creating a project, the frameworks required need to be decided along with the versions of the frameworks that are compatible with each other. Spring Boot does that work for us.

It has already created a set of dependencies with compatible versions. The developer only needs to choose the uber dependency (like starter web) and Spring Boot configures appropriate versions of Spring core, dispatcher servlet, view resolver, logging, security and validation frameworks along with exception handling and support for internationalization. 

 Spring Boot takes care of the configuration part for us so we can focus on developing the business logic. Spring Boot saves the time spent on creating a Spring application from scratch

Spring Boot offers starter projects which have a set of predefined dependencies. These dependencies are automatically provided to the project to simplify the build configuration.

### Starter-web

**Starter web** is the preferred starter for building web applications, including RESTful applications, using Spring MVC. It uses Tomcat as the default embedded container. 

### Starter Test

**Starter test** is the starter dependency for testing Spring Boot applications with libraries including JUnit Jupiter, Hamcrest, and Mockito.`spring-boot-starter-test` enables the developer to write unit and integration tests.

### Starter JPA

JPA is the interface for the Hibernate framework. `starter-data-jpa` is used for Spring Data JPA with Hibernate. 

# Creating a REST service

- The "Spring Web" dependency that we add results in a lot of jars being downloaded. These can be seen in the "Maven Dependencies" folder and include `jackson-databind`, `tomcat`, `spring-webmvc`, and `json`, etc. If we were to create a REST application without Spring Boot, we would need to add the `spring-webmvc`, `jackson-databind`, `servlet-api` for configuring the dispatcher servlet, as well as other dependencies that Spring Boot automatically downloaded for us. Spring Boot provides us with an embedded server.
    
    When we open the application and run it, the log says: "Tomcat started on port 8080". This means that we have a web application up and running. Tomcat runs on port 8080 by default. To verify that the server is running, we can go to the web browser and type `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. This results in an error from the Tomcat servlet container saying there is no mapping for `/error` defined. This is because we have not provided any mapping for localhost. So, when the server tries to go to `/error` and finds no mapping, it throws an error.
    

## @RestController

• To create a controller, we will create a class  and use an annotation `@RestController` to inform Spring that this is a controller class. A controller is a Java class that maps a URI to a method. When the method is executed, it returns a response. A `@RestController` is a specialized form of `@Controller` annotation which handles REST requests and responses. It automatically handles conversion to JSON.

eg. 

```bash
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class RecommendationsController {
  //method to return all movies
}
```

# Devtools Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
</dependency>

```

![image.png](Spring%20Boot%201b276e26cece80579a42cc10100440f0/image%201.png)

If the scope of this dependency is limited to runtime using the tag `<scope>runtime</scope>`, it will not be packaged in the JAR.

# Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator is a feature that provides monitoring features for the application during development and after deployment. It provides metadata about the application like the beans configured, how autoconfiguration has worked, how many times a specific service is called, how many times a specific service has failed, etc.

![image.png](Spring%20Boot%201b276e26cece80579a42cc10100440f0/image%202.png)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The Actuator exposes a lot of REST services that are compliant with the **HAL** standard. We will use a HAL browser to view the data provided by the services. A HAL browser is a tool that understands the HAL format and can render it in a human-readable format, allowing us to explore the API and follow links between resources. For this, add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-browser</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.6.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

Since we have enabled the HAL browser, if we type `localhost:8080`, we will be taken to the HAL browser that we can use to browse through the Actuator by typing `/actuator`. The URL to launch the Actuator is `http://localhost:8080/actuator`

### **/actuator/health endpoint**

- This endpoint provides information about the health status of the application as a whole. Upon accessing this endpoint, Spring Boot returns a JSON response containing details about the overall health status of the application components, such as the database, messaging queues, disk space, and any other health indicators configured in our application.
- The response typically includes indicators of the application's health, such as "status" (UP or DOWN), details about any dependencies, and additional custom health checks that have been implemented.

### **/actuator/health/{path} endpoint**

- This endpoint allows us to check the health status of a specific component or subsystem within the application. The `{path}` placeholder represents the path to the specific health indicator or subsystem we want to check. For example, `/actuator/health/db` is used to check the health of the database connection.
- When we access this endpoint with a specific path, Spring Boot returns a JSON response containing the health status of the specified component. The response includes similar information to the `/actuator/health` endpoint but focused specifically on the component identified by the `{path}`.

## **Changing the actuator URL**

- The Actuator calculates metrics related to application performance and makes them available as a new endpoint, e.g., `/health` without us having to write any controller for it. These metrics are deployed along with the application. The application URL will also have the `/health` URL. This can be changed to some other location by adding the following line in the `application.properties` file:
- 

```xml
Management.server.port = 8081
```

Changing the actuator endpoint

- If this change is made, then the application will be accessible at `localhost:8080` and health information at port `8081`.

## **Actuator endpoints**

By default, only `/health` and `/health/{*path}` are available. The other endpoints are disabled. To enable the web exposure of all management endpoints, add the following line to `application.properties` file:

```xml
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

- `/auditevents` shows audit information like which users were validated, or how many users failed the authentication test, etc.
- `/beans` shows all the spring beans that are configured. It shows the name of the bean as well as scope and type, and any dependencies that the bean might have. It can be used to analyze the application.
- `/condition` shows all the positive and negative matches for autoconfiguration similar to the report that is generated at application startup.
- `/httptrace` shows the last 100 requests that were executed along with the response that was sent back.
- `/mappings` shows all the URI’s for `@RequestMapping`.
- `/metrics` shows a list of valid metrics. Further information about any metric can be obtained by copying the metric and adding it to the url. For example, the `jvm.memory.used` will show the amount of memory used.
- `/shutdown` when enabled, lets the application gracefully shutdown. The feature can be enabled by making the following changes to the `application.properties` file:

```xml
management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true
```

## **HAL browser**

HAL browsers are tools designed to visualize and interact with APIs that adhere to the HAL standard. Since we have enabled the HAL browser, we can view it at `http://localhost:8080/browser/index.html`

# SB vs SpringMVC

Spring Boot and Spring MVC are both components of the Spring framework. Spring offers dependency injection and inversion of control, which provides good integration with other frameworks. It defines beans using different annotations and autowires them. Spring helps build loosely coupled applications that are easy to unit test. It also eliminates plumbing code like exception handling, establishing and closing connections, etc.

## SpringMVC

**Spring MVC** is an HTTP oriented Spring framework, which is concerned with developing web applications. It makes use of the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern to achieve separation of concerns, where:

- Model: Represents the application's data and business logic.
- View: Renders the user interface for interacting with the application.
- Controller: Handles incoming requests, processes them, and determines the appropriate response.

![image.png](Spring%20Boot%201b276e26cece80579a42cc10100440f0/image%203.png)

The *Dispatcher Servlet* is the front controller that handles all requests while the *View Resolver* is concerned with resolving view names to physical views. This decoupling makes development of web applications and RESTful services very simple because the model, view, and controller operate without dependency. In the previous lessons, when we built a web service with Spring Boot, it internally made use of Spring MVC. Spring MVC helps create web applications that are scalable as well as testable.

Spring MVC provides features such as, request mapping and routing capabilities, support for handling form submissions, validation, and data binding, integration with various view technologies, including JSP, Thymeleaf, and others, interception and aspect-oriented programming (AOP) for cross-cutting concerns.

In short, Spring MVC offers flexibility and fine-grained control over the application's behavior, making it suitable for building complex and customized web applications.

## **Spring Boot**

Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of setting up and configuring Spring-based applications. It aims to streamline the development experience by providing out-of-the-box configurations, auto-configuration, and convention-over-configuration principles.

Spring Boot is designed to solve configuration issues. It autoconfigures a lot of dependencies based on the kind of application that is being built. Spring Boot offers pre-configured projects to bootstrap an application in a few simple steps. When building a web application using Spring Boot, the DispatcherServlet, ViewResolver, Data Source, Transaction Manager, etc. get configured automatically. Spring Boot configures compatible versions of the dependencies needed for the frameworks. Other key features of Spring Boot include standalone executable JAR files with embedded servlet containers, and actuator for monitoring, and troubleshooting applications through a set of production-ready endpoints.

Spring Boot helps kickstart the project by bringing in all the required dependencies. It is a useful tool for someone who is just starting out with Spring and gets overwhelmed with the configuration part. It also saves a lot of time by making deployment and distribution straightforward.

However it offers an opinionated (biased) setup as it encourages best practices and conventions, allowing developers to focus on building business logic rather than boilerplate configuration.

## **Choosing between Spring Boot and Spring MVC**

With the above discussion in mind, let's breakdown how to make the choice between Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

Use Spring MVC when:

1. You require fine-grained control over the application's configuration and behavior.
2. You need to integrate with specific libraries or technologies that are not supported out-of-the-box by Spring Boot.
3. You are building a traditional web application with complex business logic and custom requirements.

Use Spring Boot when:

1. You prioritize rapid development, simplicity, and convention-over-configuration.
2. You are building microservices, RESTful APIs, or cloud-native applications where containerization and easy deployment are crucial.
3. You want to leverage Spring Boot's auto-configuration and opinionated setup to reduce boilerplate code and configuration.
